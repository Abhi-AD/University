        <p>Oxford’s graduate courses are challenging and intensive: we expect a lot from our graduate students. Our approach to graduate study emphasises your 
            ability to work independently, while supported by a world-class academic community.

                <p>An intermediate good is a product used to produce a final good or finished product—also referred to as a consumer good.Intermediate goods—like 
                    salt—can also be finished products, since it is consumed directly by consumers and used by producers  to manufacture other food products. 
                    Intermediate goods are sold between industries for resale or the production of other goods. These goods are also called semi-finished products 
                    because they are used as inputs to become part of the finished product.</p>

                <h3>Post Graduation</h3>
                <p>Postgraduate education (graduate education in North America) involves learning and studying for academic or professional degrees, academic or
                     professional certificates, academic or professional diplomas, or other qualifications for which a first or bachelor's degree generally is 
                     required, and it is normally considered to be part of higher education. In North America, this level is typically referred to as graduate 
                     school (and often colloquially as grad school).The organization and structure of postgraduate education varies in different countries, as 
                     well as in different institutions within countries.This article outlines the basic types of courses and of teaching and examination 
                     methods, with some explanation of their history.</p>

        <h1>Our Facilities</h1>
        <p>Water, electricity, public transport and healthcare are some of the basic things that we all need in our day to day lives. The Constitution recognizes
            the right to water as a part of our fundamental right to life. To prevent the water-borne diseases like cholera and dysentery, proper sanitation and
            safe drinking water is a must. The right to safe drinking water has been considered a fundamental right in recent court cases.The presence of proper
            public facilities like electricity and public transport would benefit many people in more ways than one. The presence of public facilities is essential 
            and the responsibility of ensuring their availability lies with the government.The government is funded by the revenue generated from taxes taken from 
            people. The details of the income and expenditure are presented to the Parliament during the annual budget session. Private companies contribute more in 
            the areas of health care and education where there is more scope for profit. The government sub-contracts the work to private companies, but at the same 
            time, ensure that the work is overseen by the government.</p>

                <p>A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool.[1]Games are 
                    distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological
                     elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator 
                     sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).</p>

                    waste food. Our world consists of different types of cultures. These cultures have varieties of dishes of food in them. Thus, all the dishes 
                    have different taste. Furthermore, our nature provides us a variety of food. From fruits to vegetables, from Dairy food to seafood everything 
                    is available. Different countries have their own specialty of dishes.</p>

                    <p>When Computer Science graduate Ray began teaching, he found the lessons prepared for students dull and uninspiring. He started developing 
                        new software for learning using Microsoft Kinect. He was encouraged by a leap in both engagement and academic achievement from his 
                        computing students, so he decided to share this work and best practice with other teachers. Ray’s YouTube channel has now had more 
                        than 250,000 hits. The BBC asked him to contribute its Microbit resources which are issued to teachers nationally in the UK. If he 
                        were to win the prize, he would use the funds to support charitable work improving computer science education in the UK and Africa.</p>

                        type in Australia. Many of Ken’s students have received scholarships to study science at university, and one class was placed first in 
                        Australia in their category of the International Science Championships. In his lessons Ken uses a variety of multimedia projects together
